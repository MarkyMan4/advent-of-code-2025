## How to run

This is a single program that takes command line arguments to tell which day/part to solve.

For example, to run day 1 part 2, run:

```bash
go run . 1 2
```

I'll add an ornament to my tree for each day I complete:

```
           \|/
          --*-- 
           / \
          /   \
         /     \
        /       \
       /         \
      /        &  \
     /             \
    /               \
   /   @             \
  /___________________\
